# Introduction to Python

Welcome to an Introduction to Python!

This book is designed to be a practical introduction to coding with Python. However, it is not intended to be an introduction to programming overall and the ideal reader will have some familiarity with another coding language in other computer science settings (e.g. Java, C) or in applied data science (e.g. MATLAB, R)
